## Installation

### Via npx (Recommended)

```bash
npx @zeero/ccresume@latest
```

### Global Installation

```bash
npm install -g @zeero/ccresume
```

## Usage

Run the command in your terminal:

```bash
ccresume
```

Or if using npx:

```bash
npx @zeero/ccresume@latest
```

### Command Line Options

#### ccresume Options

```bash
# Hide specific message types
ccresume --hide              # Default: hides tool and thinking messages
ccresume --hide tool         # Hide only tool messages
ccresume --hide thinking      # Hide only thinking messages
ccresume --hide user         # Hide only user messages
ccresume --hide assistant    # Hide only assistant messages
ccresume --hide tool thinking user  # Hide multiple types

# Filter to current directory
ccresume .

# Show help
ccresume --help
ccresume -h

# Show version
ccresume --version
ccresume -v
```

#### Passing Options to Claude

All unrecognized command-line arguments are passed directly to the `claude` command when resuming a conversation.

```bash
# Pass options to claude
ccresume --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Multiple options
ccresume --model opus --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Combine ccresume and claude options
ccresume --hide tool --model opus 
ccresume . --hide --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**⚠️ Warning**: Since unrecognized arguments are passed to claude, avoid using options that conflict with ccresume's functionality:
- Don't use options like `--resume` or something like that changes claude's interactive behavior

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 20 / 22 / 24 (LTS)
- **Claude Code** - Must be installed and configured
- **Operating System** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (both native & WSL)

## Command Editor

Press `-` to open the command editor, where you can configure Claude CLI options before starting or resuming a session. The editor provides:

- **Autocomplete suggestions** - Type `-` to see matching Claude options
- **Official help text** - View all available Claude CLI options
- **Interactive editing** - Use arrow keys, Tab for autocomplete, Enter to confirm

The configured options will be passed to Claude when you start a new session (`n`) or resume a conversation (`Enter`).

**Note**: The options list is based on Claude's help text at a specific point in time. Please refer to `claude --help` for the latest available options. Some options like `-r`, `-c`, `-h` may interfere with ccresume's functionality.

## 🐞 Known Issues

Below are known issues and limitations. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

| No. | Title | Description | Issue |
|:---:|:------|:-------------|:-----|
| 1 | **Incomplete conversation history restoration on resume** | When resuming with ccresume, sometimes, only the tail end of the history is restored. Although the interactive `claude -r` can restore full history. Workaround: use `claude -r` interactively or `claude -c`. | [#2](https://github.com/zeero/ccresume/issues/2) |
| 2 | **~~Restore original console state after exiting ccresume~~** | ~~Exiting `ccresume` leaves the chat selection interface visible and hides previous terminal content.~~ **This is fixed in v0.3.1**: Terminal scrollback buffer is now preserved when exiting. | [#3](https://github.com/zeero/ccresume/issues/3) |
| 3 | **Resume ordering may be incorrect** | For performance issue, `ccresume` sorts logs by file system timestamps (not chat content), so display order may not match actual chronology after migration. Workaround: preserve file timestamps. | – |
| 4 | **Windows native terminal limitations** | On Windows native terminals, interactive features may have limited functionality due to terminal input handling differences. Temporarily, in the Windows native environment, a warning message will be displayed before startup. | [#32](https://github.com/zeero/ccresume/issues/32) |
